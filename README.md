# Realtime-Evaluation Project

## Description
The `realtime-evaluation` project is an innovative solution designed to enhance the interaction between AI and human agents by providing real-time quality assessments of AI-generated responses. Utilizing a sophisticated Kafka pipeline, this system captures AI response data and sentiment analysis, alerting human agents to the quality of interactions. This enables immediate human intervention when necessary, ensuring a high standard of customer service and a seamless user experience.
